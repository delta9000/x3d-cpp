# EventUtility System

The EventUtility System implements the ISO/IEC 19775-1 §30 Event Utilities
component — a cluster of seven node types that wire boolean/integer logic and
stepwise sequencing directly via ROUTEs, without requiring an ECMAScript
`Script`. Before this system was introduced, every one of these nodes was
behaviorally inert: their `inputOnly` handlers were the empty default, so any
ROUTE into them was silently dropped. The system was introduced as part of the
conformance campaign wave-3 fix cycle (commit `47c0714`), closing 16 findings
(TRIG-1/2/3/5/6, SEQ-1..5/7/8, EUF-1/2/4/5).

## Purpose

The subsystem gives behavioral life to seven X3D node types that the generated
bindings define but whose handlers were never wired to a `System`:

| Node | Spec clause | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `BooleanTrigger` | §30.4.4 | Any `set_triggerTime` → emits `triggerTrue=TRUE` |
| `IntegerTrigger` | §30.4.6 | `set_boolean=TRUE` → emits `triggerValue=integerKey`; FALSE ignored |
| `TimeTrigger` | §30.4.7 | Any `set_boolean` (value irrelevant) → emits `triggerTime=now` |
| `BooleanFilter` | §30.4.1 | Routes `inputTrue`/`inputFalse` by value; always emits `inputNegate` |
| `BooleanToggle` | §30.4.3 | `set_boolean=TRUE` flips `toggle`; FALSE is a no-op |
| `BooleanSequencer` | §30.3.1 | Stepwise `value_changed` (SFBool) on `set_fraction`; `next`/`previous` step with wrap |
| `IntegerSequencer` | §30.2.4 | Stepwise `value_changed` (SFInt32) on `set_fraction`; `next`/`previous` step with wrap |

All seven are event-driven (not time-driven): they register an `inputOnly`
handler in `attach()` and leave `update()` a no-op. Each handler calls
`ctx.postEvent(...)` to emit the spec-mandated output, which the cascade then
fans out along any downstream ROUTEs.

The sequencer stepwise-selection rule (`sequencerStepIndex`) deserves explicit
notation: it is the largest index `i` such that `key[i] <= t`, boundary-clamped
at both ends. On duplicate key values, the lowest index wins (SEQ-7: "first
definition wins") — implemented by walking back while `key[i] == t && key[i-1]
== key[i]`. This is NOT linear interpolation.

## Key files

| File / directory | Role |
|---|---|
| `runtime/events/EventUtilitySystem.hpp` | All seven System classes + `sequencerStepIndex`; the entire subsystem is header-only |
| `runtime/events/X3DSceneBridge.hpp` | `attachEventUtilities(scene, ctx)` — production wiring; iterates every node in the scene, calls `attach` on each system, then registers all seven with `ctx.addSystem` |
| `runtime/events/X3DSystem.hpp` | `System` base class (`attach` / `update`) that all seven classes extend |
| `runtime/events/X3DExecutionContext.hpp` | `postEvent` + `addSystem` + `tick` — the cascade/context seams the systems call |
| `generated_cpp_bindings/x3d/nodes/BooleanFilter.hpp` | `setOnSet_booleanHandler` / `emitInput*` accessors |
| `generated_cpp_bindings/x3d/nodes/BooleanToggle.hpp` | `setOnSet_booleanHandler` / `getToggle` |
| `generated_cpp_bindings/x3d/nodes/BooleanTrigger.hpp` | `setOnSet_triggerTimeHandler` / `emitTriggerTrue` |
| `generated_cpp_bindings/x3d/nodes/IntegerTrigger.hpp` | `setOnSet_booleanHandler` / `getIntegerKey` / `emitTriggerValue` |
| `generated_cpp_bindings/x3d/nodes/TimeTrigger.hpp` | `setOnSet_booleanHandler` / `emitTriggerTime` |
| `generated_cpp_bindings/x3d/nodes/BooleanSequencer.hpp` | `setOnSet_fractionHandler` / `setOnNextHandler` / `setOnPreviousHandler` / `getKey` / `getKeyValue` |
| `generated_cpp_bindings/x3d/nodes/IntegerSequencer.hpp` | Same handler pattern; `getKeyValue()` returns `MFInt32` |
| `runtime/events/tests/event_utility_test.cpp` | Behavioral conformance tests |

## Interfaces and seams

### Exposed interface

The primary entry points are the seven `System` subclasses and the production
wiring helper:

```cpp
namespace x3d::runtime {

// Individual systems — attach + register manually if fine-grained control
// is needed:
class BooleanTriggerSystem  : public System { ... };
class IntegerTriggerSystem  : public System { ... };
class TimeTriggerSystem     : public System { ... };
class BooleanFilterSystem   : public System { ... };
class BooleanToggleSystem   : public System { ... };

template <typename NodeT, typename ValueT>
class SequencerSystem       : public System { ... };

// Step-index helper (exposed inline; also used by the sequencer systems):
std::size_t sequencerStepIndex(const MFFloat &key, float t);

} // namespace x3d::runtime

// Production wiring — the normal call site (in X3DSceneBridge.hpp):
void attachEventUtilities(Scene &scene, X3DExecutionContext &ctx);
```

`attachEventUtilities` constructs one instance of each system, walks every node
in the scene calling `sys->attach(n, ctx)` (each system guards with a
`dynamic_cast` and returns immediately on a type miss), then calls
`ctx.addSystem(std::move(sys))` so the context retains ownership.

### Seam points

- **`System::attach(node, ctx)`** — the only entry point each system needs;
  wires the node's `inputOnly` handler closure. No `update` override is needed
  (all seven nodes are event-driven). The `System` base is in
  `runtime/events/X3DSystem.hpp`.

- **`ctx.postEvent(node, field, value)`** — the mechanism handlers use to emit
  outputs. `postEvent` seeds a pending event into the cascade; the cascade
  delivers it to the node's reflected field table and fans out along all ROUTEs
  from that field within the same tick. Declared on `X3DExecutionContext`
  (`runtime/events/X3DExecutionContext.hpp`).

- **`ctx.now()`** — `TimeTriggerSystem` reads this to stamp `triggerTime`. The
  clock is advanced by `ctx.tick(now)` before systems run, so `now()` is the
  current-tick timestamp.

- **`setOnSet_<field>Handler(fn)`** — the generated binding API that the systems
  call in `attach`. Each `inputOnly` field on the generated node class has a
  corresponding `setOnXxxHandler` registration method; the cascade delivers into
  the corresponding `onXxx` dispatch method, which calls the stored functor.

- **`SequencerSystem::index_`** — a per-system `unordered_map<X3DNode*, size_t>`
  that tracks the current keyValue index for each enrolled sequencer node across
  ticks, so `next`/`previous` step from the last fraction-set position rather
  than resetting to zero each time.

- **`attachEventUtilities` (in `X3DSceneBridge.hpp`)** — the production caller.
  Must be called after `ctx.buildSceneGraph(scene)` and `ctx.buildFrom(scene)`
  so route resolution and the scene node index are in place before attachment.
  The `x3d sim` command wires it through
  `x3d::sim::attachFullRuntime(scene, ctx)` (`tools/x3d-cli/sim_runtime.hpp`).

## How it is tested

- **`ctest --preset dev -R x3d_events_tests`** (doctest case: `event_utility_test`) — the primary behavioral
  conformance test (`runtime/events/tests/event_utility_test.cpp`). Covers all
  seven node types and 16 conformance IDs:
  - TRIG-1/2: `BooleanTrigger` emits `triggerTrue=TRUE`; `IntegerTrigger`
    emits `triggerValue=integerKey` on TRUE and ignores FALSE.
  - TRIG-3/5: `TimeTrigger` fires on both TRUE and FALSE values of `set_boolean`.
  - EUF-1/4: `BooleanFilter` emits exactly one of `inputTrue`/`inputFalse` (by
    value) plus always `inputNegate`; the mutually-exclusive selection logic is
    confirmed.
  - EUF-2: `BooleanToggle` flips on TRUE and no-ops on FALSE.
  - SEQ-1..5/8: `IntegerSequencer` and `BooleanSequencer` stepwise selection
    across boundary and mid-range fractions; `next`/`previous` step with
    wrap-around.
  - SEQ-7: duplicate key values → lowest index wins (confirmed with a
    four-key fixture).
  - Production wiring (`attachEventUtilities`) is smoke-tested end-to-end
    via a `BooleanToggle` and `IntegerSequencer` exercised through the cascade.

- **Golden regression** — the wave-3 fix was verified byte-identical against the
  committed golden files; ctest advanced to 129/129 at ship. The golden gate
  continues to guard against inadvertent output changes.

- **`x3d sim` behavioral correctness tests** (`tools/x3d-cli/goldens/`) —
  `attachFullRuntime` wires `attachEventUtilities`, so the CLI sim golden traces
  implicitly exercise the event-utility systems on real corpus fixtures.

## Open findings

One finding remains open after the wave-3 fix cycle:

- **TRIG-4** (`docs/conformance/findings.yaml`) — `IntegerTrigger.integerKey`
  is an `inputOutput` field; a write to it via ROUTE should also emit
  `integerKey_changed`/`triggerValue_changed` side-effects (§30.4.6).
  Deferred for a targeted re-review of the spec prose.

Follower nodes (`X3DFollowerNode` / §39 Chaser/Damper) were audited alongside
Event Utilities in wave-3 (FOL-1..9) but are deferred per `docs/conformance/findings.yaml`:
§39 is advanced, has low corpus prevalence, and has no current consumer. They are
behaviorally inert (no `FollowerSystem` wired); closing them needs a dedicated
time-integration easing System, NOT a rigid-body physics engine — Chasers/Dampers
ease an output toward a destination over a duration, independent of the physics seam.
